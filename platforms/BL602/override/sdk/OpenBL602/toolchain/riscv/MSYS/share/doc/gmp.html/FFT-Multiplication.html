<h4 class="subsection">15.1.6 FFT Multiplication</h4>
<a name="index-FFT-multiplication-1"></a>
<a name="index-Fast-Fourier-Transform"></a>

<p>At large to very large sizes a Fermat style FFT multiplication is used,
following Sch&ouml;nhage and Strassen (see <a href="References.html#References">References</a>).  Descriptions of FFTs
in various forms can be found in many textbooks, for instance Knuth section
4.3.3 part C or Lipson chapter IX.  A brief description of the form used in
GMP is given here.
</p>
<p>The multiplication done is <em>x*y mod 2^N+1</em>, for a given
<em>N</em>.  A full product <em>x*y</em> is obtained by choosing <em>N&gt;=bits(x)+bits(y)</em> and padding
<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> with high zero limbs.  The modular product is the native
form for the algorithm, so padding to get a full product is unavoidable.
</p>
<p>The algorithm follows a split, evaluate, pointwise multiply, interpolate and
combine similar to that described above for Karatsuba and Toom-3.  A <em>k</em>
parameter controls the split, with an FFT-<em>k</em> splitting into <em>2^k</em>
pieces of <em>M=N/2^k</em> bits each.  <em>N</em> must be a multiple of
<em>(2^k)*<code>mp_bits_per_limb</code></em> so
the split falls on limb boundaries, avoiding bit shifts in the split and
combine stages.
</p>
<p>The evaluations, pointwise multiplications, and interpolation, are all done
modulo <em>2^N'+1</em> where <em>N'</em> is <em>2M+k+3</em> rounded up to a
multiple of <em>2^k</em> and of <code>mp_bits_per_limb</code>.  The results of
interpolation will be the following negacyclic convolution of the input
pieces, and the choice of <em>N'</em> ensures these sums aren&rsquo;t truncated.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">           ---
           \         b
w[n] =     /     (-1) * x[i] * y[j]
           ---
       i+j==b*2^k+n
          b=0,1
</pre></div>

<p>The points used for the evaluation are <em>g^i</em> for <em>i=0</em> to
<em>2^k-1</em> where <em>g=2^(2N'/2^k)</em>.  <em>g</em> is a
<em>2^k'</em>th root of unity mod <em>2^N'+1</em>, which produces necessary
cancellations at the interpolation stage, and it&rsquo;s also a power of 2 so the
fast Fourier transforms used for the evaluation and interpolation do only
shifts, adds and negations.
</p>
<p>The pointwise multiplications are done modulo <em>2^N'+1</em> and either
recurse into a further FFT or use a plain multiplication (Toom-3, Karatsuba or
basecase), whichever is optimal at the size <em>N'</em>.  The interpolation is
an inverse fast Fourier transform.  The resulting set of sums of <em>x[i]*y[j]</em> are added at appropriate offsets to give the final result.
</p>
<p>Squaring is the same, but <em>x</em> is the only input so it&rsquo;s one transform at
the evaluate stage and the pointwise multiplies are squares.  The
interpolation is the same.
</p>
<p>For a mod <em>2^N+1</em> product, an FFT-<em>k</em> is an <em>O(N^(k/(k-1)))</em> algorithm, the exponent representing <em>2^k</em> recursed
modular multiplies each <em>1/2^(k-1)</em> the size of the original.
Each successive <em>k</em> is an asymptotic improvement, but overheads mean each
is only faster at bigger and bigger sizes.  In the code, <code>MUL_FFT_TABLE</code>
and <code>SQR_FFT_TABLE</code> are the thresholds where each <em>k</em> is used.  Each
new <em>k</em> effectively swaps some multiplying for some shifts, adds and
overheads.
</p>
<p>A mod <em>2^N+1</em> product can be formed with a normal
<em>NxN-&gt;2N</em> bit multiply plus a subtraction, so an FFT
and Toom-3 etc can be compared directly.  A <em>k=4</em> FFT at
<em>O(N^1.333<!-- /@w -->)</em> can be expected to be the first faster than Toom-3 at
<em>O(N^1.465<!-- /@w -->)</em>.  In practice this is what&rsquo;s found, with
<code>MUL_FFT_MODF_THRESHOLD</code> and <code>SQR_FFT_MODF_THRESHOLD</code> being between
300 and 1000 limbs, depending on the CPU.  So far it&rsquo;s been found that only
very large FFTs recurse into pointwise multiplies above these sizes.
</p>
<p>When an FFT is to give a full product, the change of <em>N</em> to <em>2N</em>
doesn&rsquo;t alter the theoretical complexity for a given <em>k</em>, but for the
purposes of considering where an FFT might be first used it can be assumed
that the FFT is recursing into a normal multiply and that on that basis it&rsquo;s
doing <em>2^k</em> recursed multiplies each <em>1/2^(k-2)</em> the size of
the inputs, making it <em>O(N^(k/(k-2)))</em>.  This would mean
<em>k=7</em> at <em>O(N^1.4<!-- /@w -->)</em> would be the first FFT faster than Toom-3.
In practice <code>MUL_FFT_THRESHOLD</code> and <code>SQR_FFT_THRESHOLD</code> have been
found to be in the <em>k=8</em> range, somewhere between 3000 and 10000 limbs.
</p>
<p>The way <em>N</em> is split into <em>2^k</em> pieces and then <em>2M+k+3</em> is
rounded up to a multiple of <em>2^k</em> and <code>mp_bits_per_limb</code> means that
when <em>2^k&gt;=<code>mp\_bits\_per\_limb</code></em> the effective <em>N</em> is a
multiple of <em>2^(2k-1)</em> bits.  The <em>+k+3</em> means some values of
<em>N</em> just under such a multiple will be rounded to the next.  The
complexity calculations above assume that a favourable size is used, meaning
one which isn&rsquo;t padded through rounding, and it&rsquo;s also assumed that the extra
<em>+k+3</em> bits are negligible at typical FFT sizes.
</p>
<p>The practical effect of the <em>2^(2k-1)</em> constraint is to introduce a
step-effect into measured speeds.  For example <em>k=8</em> will round <em>N</em>
up to a multiple of 32768 bits, so for a 32-bit limb there&rsquo;ll be 512 limb
groups of sizes for which <code>mpn_mul_n</code> runs at the same speed.  Or for
<em>k=9</em> groups of 2048 limbs, <em>k=10</em> groups of 8192 limbs, etc.  In
practice it&rsquo;s been found each <em>k</em> is used at quite small multiples of its
size constraint and so the step effect is quite noticeable in a time versus
size graph.
</p>
<p>The threshold determinations currently measure at the mid-points of size
steps, but this is sub-optimal since at the start of a new step it can happen
that it&rsquo;s better to go back to the previous <em>k</em> for a while.  Something
more sophisticated for <code>MUL_FFT_TABLE</code> and <code>SQR_FFT_TABLE</code> will be
needed.
