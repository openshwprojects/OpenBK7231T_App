<span id="Efficiency-1"></span><h3 class="section">3.11 Efficiency</h3>
<span id="index-Efficiency"></span>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt>Small Operands</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Small-operands"></span>
<p>On small operands, the time for function call overheads and memory allocation
can be significant in comparison to actual calculation.  This is unavoidable
in a general purpose variable precision library, although GMP attempts to be
as efficient as it can on both large and small operands.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Static Linking</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Static-linking"></span>
<p>On some CPUs, in particular the x86s, the static <samp>libgmp.a</samp> should be
used for maximum speed, since the PIC code in the shared <samp>libgmp.so</samp> will
have a small overhead on each function call and global data address.  For many
programs this will be insignificant, but for long calculations there&rsquo;s a gain
to be had.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Initializing and Clearing</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Initializing-and-clearing"></span>
<p>Avoid excessive initializing and clearing of variables, since this can be
quite time consuming, especially in comparison to otherwise fast operations
like addition.
</p>
<p>A language interpreter might want to keep a free list or stack of
initialized variables ready for use.  It should be possible to integrate
something like that with a garbage collector too.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Reallocations</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Reallocations"></span>
<p>An <code>mpz_t</code> or <code>mpq_t</code> variable used to hold successively increasing
values will have its memory repeatedly <code>realloc</code>ed, which could be quite
slow or could fragment memory, depending on the C library.  If an application
can estimate the final size then <code>mpz_init2</code> or <code>mpz_realloc2</code> can
be called to allocate the necessary space from the beginning
(see <a href="Initializing-Integers.html">Initializing Integers</a>).
</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if a size set with <code>mpz_init2</code> or <code>mpz_realloc2</code>
is too small, since all functions will do a further reallocation if necessary.
Badly overestimating memory required will waste space though.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>2exp</code> Functions</dt>
<dd><span id="index-2exp-functions"></span>
<p>It&rsquo;s up to an application to call functions like <code>mpz_mul_2exp</code> when
appropriate.  General purpose functions like <code>mpz_mul</code> make no attempt to
identify powers of two or other special forms, because such inputs will
usually be very rare and testing every time would be wasteful.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ui</code> and <code>si</code> Functions</dt>
<dd><span id="index-ui-and-si-functions"></span>
<p>The <code>ui</code> functions and the small number of <code>si</code> functions exist for
convenience and should be used where applicable.  But if for example an
<code>mpz_t</code> contains a value that fits in an <code>unsigned long</code> there&rsquo;s no
need extract it and call a <code>ui</code> function, just use the regular <code>mpz</code>
function.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>In-Place Operations</dt>
<dd><span id="index-In_002dplace-operations"></span>
<p><code>mpz_abs</code>, <code>mpq_abs</code>, <code>mpf_abs</code>, <code>mpz_neg</code>, <code>mpq_neg</code>
and <code>mpf_neg</code> are fast when used for in-place operations like
<code>mpz_abs(x,x)</code>, since in the current implementation only a single field
of <code>x</code> needs changing.  On suitable compilers (GCC for instance) this is
inlined too.
</p>
<p><code>mpz_add_ui</code>, <code>mpz_sub_ui</code>, <code>mpf_add_ui</code> and <code>mpf_sub_ui</code>
benefit from an in-place operation like <code>mpz_add_ui(x,x,y)</code>, since
usually only one or two limbs of <code>x</code> will need to be changed.  The same
applies to the full precision <code>mpz_add</code> etc if <code>y</code> is small.  If
<code>y</code> is big then cache locality may be helped, but that&rsquo;s all.
</p>
<p><code>mpz_mul</code> is currently the opposite, a separate destination is slightly
better.  A call like <code>mpz_mul(x,x,y)</code> will, unless <code>y</code> is only one
limb, make a temporary copy of <code>x</code> before forming the result.  Normally
that copying will only be a tiny fraction of the time for the multiply, so
this is not a particularly important consideration.
</p>
<p><code>mpz_set</code>, <code>mpq_set</code>, <code>mpq_set_num</code>, <code>mpf_set</code>, etc, make
no attempt to recognise a copy of something to itself, so a call like
<code>mpz_set(x,x)</code> will be wasteful.  Naturally that would never be written
deliberately, but if it might arise from two pointers to the same object then
a test to avoid it might be desirable.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">if (x != y)
  mpz_set (x, y);
</pre></div>

<p>Note that it&rsquo;s never worth introducing extra <code>mpz_set</code> calls just to get
in-place operations.  If a result should go to a particular variable then just
direct it there and let GMP take care of data movement.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Divisibility Testing (Small Integers)</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Divisibility-testing"></span>
<p><code>mpz_divisible_ui_p</code> and <code>mpz_congruent_ui_p</code> are the best functions
for testing whether an <code>mpz_t</code> is divisible by an individual small
integer.  They use an algorithm which is faster than <code>mpz_tdiv_ui</code>, but
which gives no useful information about the actual remainder, only whether
it&rsquo;s zero (or a particular value).
</p>
<p>However when testing divisibility by several small integers, it&rsquo;s best to take
a remainder modulo their product, to save multi-precision operations.  For
instance to test whether a number is divisible by any of 23, 29 or 31 take a
remainder modulo <em>23*29*31 = 20677</em> and then test that.
</p>
<p>The division functions like <code>mpz_tdiv_q_ui</code> which give a quotient as well
as a remainder are generally a little slower than the remainder-only functions
like <code>mpz_tdiv_ui</code>.  If the quotient is only rarely wanted then it&rsquo;s
probably best to just take a remainder and then go back and calculate the
quotient if and when it&rsquo;s wanted (<code>mpz_divexact_ui</code> can be used if the
remainder is zero).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rational Arithmetic</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Rational-arithmetic"></span>
<p>The <code>mpq</code> functions operate on <code>mpq_t</code> values with no common factors
in the numerator and denominator.  Common factors are checked-for and cast out
as necessary.  In general, cancelling factors every time is the best approach
since it minimizes the sizes for subsequent operations.
</p>
<p>However, applications that know something about the factorization of the
values they&rsquo;re working with might be able to avoid some of the GCDs used for
canonicalization, or swap them for divisions.  For example when multiplying by
a prime it&rsquo;s enough to check for factors of it in the denominator instead of
doing a full GCD.  Or when forming a big product it might be known that very
little cancellation will be possible, and so canonicalization can be left to
the end.
</p>
<p>The <code>mpq_numref</code> and <code>mpq_denref</code> macros give access to the
numerator and denominator to do things outside the scope of the supplied
<code>mpq</code> functions.  See <a href="Applying-Integer-Functions.html">Applying Integer Functions</a>.
</p>
<p>The canonical form for rationals allows mixed-type <code>mpq_t</code> and integer
additions or subtractions to be done directly with multiples of the
denominator.  This will be somewhat faster than <code>mpq_add</code>.  For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">/* mpq increment */
mpz_add (mpq_numref(q), mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q));

/* mpq += unsigned long */
mpz_addmul_ui (mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q), 123UL);

/* mpq -= mpz */
mpz_submul (mpq_numref(q), mpq_denref(q), z);
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt>Number Sequences</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Number-sequences"></span>
<p>Functions like <code>mpz_fac_ui</code>, <code>mpz_fib_ui</code> and <code>mpz_bin_uiui</code>
are designed for calculating isolated values.  If a range of values is wanted
it&rsquo;s probably best to call to get a starting point and iterate from there.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Text Input/Output</dt>
<dd><span id="index-Text-input_002foutput"></span>
<p>Hexadecimal or octal are suggested for input or output in text form.
Power-of-2 bases like these can be converted much more efficiently than other
bases, like decimal.  For big numbers there&rsquo;s usually nothing of particular
interest to be seen in the digits, so the base doesn&rsquo;t matter much.
</p>
<p>Maybe we can hope octal will one day become the normal base for everyday use,
as proposed by King Charles XII of Sweden and later reformers.
