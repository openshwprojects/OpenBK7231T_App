<div class="example">
<pre class="example">ar [<samp>-X32_64</samp>] [<samp>-</samp>]<var>p</var>[<var>mod</var>] [<samp>--plugin</samp> <var>name</var>] [<samp>--target</samp> <var>bfdname</var>] [<samp>--output</samp> <var>dirname</var>] [<var>relpos</var>] [<var>count</var>] <var>archive</var> [<var>member</var>&hellip;]
</pre></div>

<span id="index-Unix-compatibility_002c-ar"></span>
<p>When you use <code>ar</code> in the Unix style, <code>ar</code> insists on at least two
arguments to execute: one keyletter specifying the <em>operation</em>
(optionally accompanied by other keyletters specifying
<em>modifiers</em>), and the archive name to act on.
</p>
<p>Most operations can also accept further <var>member</var> arguments,
specifying particular files to operate on.
</p>

<p><small>GNU</small> <code>ar</code> allows you to mix the operation code <var>p</var> and modifier
flags <var>mod</var> in any order, within the first command-line argument.
</p>
<p>If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
dash.
</p>
<span id="index-operations-on-archive"></span>
<p>The <var>p</var> keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be
any of the following, but you must specify only one of them:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>d</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-deleting-from-archive"></span>
<p><em>Delete</em> modules from the archive.  Specify the names of modules to
be deleted as <var>member</var>&hellip;; the archive is untouched if you
specify no files to delete.
</p>
<p>If you specify the &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; modifier, <code>ar</code> lists each module
as it is deleted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-moving-in-archive"></span>
<p>Use this operation to <em>move</em> members in an archive.
</p>
<p>The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how
programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in more
than one member.
</p>
<p>If no modifiers are used with <code>m</code>, any members you name in the
<var>member</var> arguments are moved to the <em>end</em> of the archive;
you can use the &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>i</samp>&rsquo; modifiers to move them to a
specified place instead.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>p</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-printing-from-archive"></span>
<p><em>Print</em> the specified members of the archive, to the standard
output file.  If the &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; modifier is specified, show the member
name before copying its contents to standard output.
</p>
<p>If you specify no <var>member</var> arguments, all the files in the archive are
printed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>q</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-quick-append-to-archive"></span>
<p><em>Quick append</em>; Historically, add the files <var>member</var>&hellip; to the end of
<var>archive</var>, without checking for replacement.
</p>
<p>The modifiers &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>i</samp>&rsquo; do <em>not</em> affect this
operation; new members are always placed at the end of the archive.
</p>
<p>The modifier &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; makes <code>ar</code> list each file as it is appended.
</p>
<p>Since the point of this operation is speed, implementations of
<code>ar</code> have the option of not updating the archive&rsquo;s symbol
table if one exists.  Too many different systems however assume that
symbol tables are always up-to-date, so <small>GNU</small> <code>ar</code> will
rebuild the table even with a quick append.
</p>
<p>Note - <small>GNU</small> <code>ar</code> treats the command &lsquo;<samp>qs</samp>&rsquo; as a
synonym for &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; - replacing already existing files in the
archive and appending new ones at the end.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-replacement-in-archive"></span>
<p>Insert the files <var>member</var>&hellip; into <var>archive</var> (with
<em>replacement</em>). This operation differs from &lsquo;<samp>q</samp>&rsquo; in that any
previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being
added.
</p>
<p>If one of the files named in <var>member</var>&hellip; does not exist, <code>ar</code>
displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing members
of the archive matching that name.
</p>
<p>By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may
use one of the modifiers &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp>i</samp>&rsquo; to request
placement relative to some existing member.
</p>
<p>The modifier &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; used with this operation elicits a line of
output for each file inserted, along with one of the letters &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member
deleted) or replaced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>s</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-ranlib"></span>
<p>Add an index to the archive, or update it if it already exists.  Note
this command is an exception to the rule that there can only be one
command letter, as it is possible to use it as either a command or a
modifier.  In either case it does the same thing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-contents-of-archive"></span>
<p>Display a <em>table</em> listing the contents of <var>archive</var>, or those
of the files listed in <var>member</var>&hellip; that are present in the
archive.  Normally only the member name is shown, but if the modifier
&lsquo;<samp>O</samp>&rsquo; is specified, then the corresponding offset of the member is also
displayed.  Finally, in order to see the modes (permissions), timestamp,
owner, group, and size the &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; modifier should be included.
</p>
<p>If you do not specify a <var>member</var>, all files in the archive
are listed.
</p>
<span id="index-repeated-names-in-archive"></span>
<span id="index-name-duplication-in-archive"></span>
<p>If there is more than one file with the same name (say, &lsquo;<samp>fie</samp>&rsquo;) in
an archive (say &lsquo;<samp>b.a</samp>&rsquo;), &lsquo;<samp>ar t b.a fie</samp>&rsquo; lists only the
first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete
listing&mdash;in our example, &lsquo;<samp>ar t b.a</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-extract-from-archive"></span>
<p><em>Extract</em> members (named <var>member</var>) from the archive.  You can
use the &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; modifier with this operation, to request that
<code>ar</code> list each name as it extracts it.
</p>
<p>If you do not specify a <var>member</var>, all files in the archive
are extracted.
</p>
<p>Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive, and there are
restrictions on extracting from archives created with <samp>P</samp>: The
paths must not be absolute, may not contain <code>..</code>, and any
subdirectories in the paths must exist.  If it is desired to avoid
these restrictions then used the <samp>--output</samp> option to specify
an output directory.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>A number of modifiers (<var>mod</var>) may immediately follow the <var>p</var>
keyletter, to specify variations on an operation&rsquo;s behavior:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-relative-placement-in-archive"></span>
<p>Add new files <em>after</em> an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier &lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the <var>relpos</var> argument, before the
<var>archive</var> specification.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Add new files <em>before</em> an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the <var>relpos</var> argument, before the
<var>archive</var> specification.  (same as &lsquo;<samp>i</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-creating-archives"></span>
<p><em>Create</em> the archive.  The specified <var>archive</var> is always
created if it did not exist, when you request an update.  But a warning is
issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by
using this modifier.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>D</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-deterministic-archives"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002denable_002ddeterministic_002darchives"></span>
<p>Operate in <em>deterministic</em> mode.  When adding files and the archive
index use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps, and use consistent file modes
for all files.  When this option is used, if <code>ar</code> is used with
identical options and identical input files, multiple runs will create
identical output files regardless of the input files&rsquo; owners, groups,
file modes, or modification times.
</p>
<p>If <samp>binutils</samp> was configured with
<samp>--enable-deterministic-archives</samp>, then this mode is on by default.
It can be disabled with the &lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo; modifier, below.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Truncate names in the archive.  <small>GNU</small> <code>ar</code> will normally permit file
names of any length.  This will cause it to create archives which are
not compatible with the native <code>ar</code> program on some systems.  If
this is a concern, the &lsquo;<samp>f</samp>&rsquo; modifier may be used to truncate file
names when putting them in the archive.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>i</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Insert new files <em>before</em> an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier &lsquo;<samp>i</samp>&rsquo;, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the <var>relpos</var> argument, before the
<var>archive</var> specification.  (same as &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>l</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This modifier is accepted but not used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>N</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Uses the <var>count</var> parameter.  This is used if there are multiple
entries in the archive with the same name.  Extract or delete instance
<var>count</var> of the given name from the archive.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>o</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-dates-in-archive"></span>
<p>Preserve the <em>original</em> dates of members when extracting them.  If
you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive
are stamped with the time of extraction.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>O</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-offsets-of-files"></span>
<p>Display member offsets inside the archive. Use together with the &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;
option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>P</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Use the full path name when matching or storing names in the archive.
Archives created with full path names are not POSIX compliant, and
thus may not work with tools other than up to date <small>GNU</small> tools.
Modifying such archives with <small>GNU</small> <code>ar</code> without using
<samp>P</samp> will remove the full path names unless the archive is a
thin archive.  Note that <samp>P</samp> may be useful when adding files to
a thin archive since <samp>r</samp> without <samp>P</samp> ignores the path
when choosing which element to replace.  Thus
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">ar rcST archive.a subdir/file1 subdir/file2 file1
</pre></div>
<p>will result in the first <code>subdir/file1</code> being replaced with
<code>file1</code> from the current directory.  Adding <samp>P</samp> will
prevent this replacement.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>s</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-writing-archive-index"></span>
<p>Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one,
even if no other change is made to the archive.  You may use this modifier
flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running &lsquo;<samp>ar s</samp>&rsquo; on an
archive is equivalent to running &lsquo;<samp>ranlib</samp>&rsquo; on it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>S</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-not-writing-archive-index"></span>
<p>Do not generate an archive symbol table.  This can speed up building a
large library in several steps.  The resulting archive can not be used
with the linker.  In order to build a symbol table, you must omit the
&lsquo;<samp>S</samp>&rsquo; modifier on the last execution of &lsquo;<samp>ar</samp>&rsquo;, or you must run
&lsquo;<samp>ranlib</samp>&rsquo; on the archive.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>T</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-creating-thin-archive"></span>
<p>Make the specified <var>archive</var> a <em>thin</em> archive.  If it already
exists and is a regular archive, the existing members must be present
in the same directory as <var>archive</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>u</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-updating-an-archive"></span>
<p>Normally, &lsquo;<samp>ar r</samp>&rsquo;&hellip; inserts all files
listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert <em>only</em> those
of the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same
names, use this modifier.  The &lsquo;<samp>u</samp>&rsquo; modifier is allowed only for the
operation &lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo; (replace).  In particular, the combination &lsquo;<samp>qu</samp>&rsquo; is
not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed
advantage from the operation &lsquo;<samp>q</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-deterministic-archives-1"></span>
<span id="index-_002d_002denable_002ddeterministic_002darchives-1"></span>
<p>Do <em>not</em> operate in <em>deterministic</em> mode.  This is the inverse
of the &lsquo;<samp>D</samp>&rsquo; modifier, above: added files and the archive index will
get their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file mode values.
</p>
<p>This is the default unless <samp>binutils</samp> was configured with
<samp>--enable-deterministic-archives</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This modifier requests the <em>verbose</em> version of an operation.  Many
operations display additional information, such as filenames processed,
when the modifier &lsquo;<samp>v</samp>&rsquo; is appended.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>V</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>This modifier shows the version number of <code>ar</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code>ar</code> program also supports some command-line options which
are neither modifiers nor actions, but which do change its behaviour
in specific ways:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--help</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Displays the list of command-line options supported by <code>ar</code>
and then exits.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--version</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Displays the version information of <code>ar</code> and then exits.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>-X32_64</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p><code>ar</code> ignores an initial option spelled &lsquo;<samp>-X32_64</samp>&rsquo;, for
compatibility with AIX.  The behaviour produced by this option is the
default for <small>GNU</small> <code>ar</code>.  <code>ar</code> does not support any
of the other &lsquo;<samp>-X</samp>&rsquo; options; in particular, it does not support
<samp>-X32</samp> which is the default for AIX <code>ar</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--plugin <var>name</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><span id="index-plugins"></span>
<p>The optional command-line switch <samp>--plugin <var>name</var></samp> causes
<code>ar</code> to load the plugin called <var>name</var> which adds support
for more file formats, including object files with link-time
optimization information.
</p>
<p>This option is only available if the toolchain has been built with
plugin support enabled.
</p>
<p>If <samp>--plugin</samp> is not provided, but plugin support has been
enabled then <code>ar</code> iterates over the files in
<samp>${libdir}/bfd-plugins</samp> in alphabetic order and the first
plugin that claims the object in question is used.
</p>
<p>Please note that this plugin search directory is <em>not</em> the one
used by <code>ld</code>&rsquo;s <samp>-plugin</samp> option.  In order to make
<code>ar</code> use the  linker plugin it must be copied into the
<samp>${libdir}/bfd-plugins</samp> directory.  For GCC based compilations
the linker plugin is called <samp>liblto_plugin.so.0.0.0</samp>.  For Clang
based compilations it is called <samp>LLVMgold.so</samp>.  The GCC plugin
is always backwards compatible with earlier versions, so it is
sufficient to just copy the newest one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--target <var>target</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The optional command-line switch <samp>--target <var>bfdname</var></samp>
specifies that the archive members are in an object code format
different from your system&rsquo;s default format.  See
See <a href="Target-Selection.html">Target Selection</a>, for more information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>--output <var>dirname</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The <samp>--output</samp> option can be used to specify a path to a
directory into which archive members should be extracted.  If this
option is not specified then the current directory will be used.
</p>
<p>Note - although the presence of this option does imply a <samp>x</samp> 
extraction operation that option must still be included on the command
line.
