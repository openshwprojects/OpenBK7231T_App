<p>If you think you have found a bug in the GNU MPC library,
please investigate
and report it. We have made this library available to you, and it is not to ask
too much from you, to ask you to report the bugs that you find.
</p>
<p>There are a few things you should think about when you put your bug report
together.
</p>
<p>You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to reproduce the
bug.  Include instructions on how to run the test case.
</p>
<p>You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if the results
printed are incorrect and in that case, in what way.
</p>
<p>Please include compiler version information in your bug report.
This can be extracted using &lsquo;<samp>gcc -v</samp>&rsquo;,
or &lsquo;<samp>cc -V</samp>&rsquo; on some machines.
Also, include the output from &lsquo;<samp>uname -a</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a corrected
version of the library; if the bug report is poor, we will not do anything about
it (aside of chiding you to send better bug reports).
</p>
<p>Send your bug report to: &lsquo;<samp>mpc-discuss@lists.gforge.inria.fr</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright incorrect, or if
the language needs to be improved, please send a note to the same address.
</p>
