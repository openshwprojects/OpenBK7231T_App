<span id="Getting-the-Return-or-Frame-Address-of-a-Function"></span><h3 class="section">6.51 Getting the Return or Frame Address of a Function</h3>

<p>These functions may be used to get information about the callers of a
function.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005freturn_005faddress">Built-in Function: <em>void *</em> <strong>__builtin_return_address</strong> <em>(unsigned int <var>level</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the return address of the current function, or of
one of its callers.  The <var>level</var> argument is number of frames to
scan up the call stack.  A value of <code>0</code> yields the return address
of the current function, a value of <code>1</code> yields the return address
of the caller of the current function, and so forth.  When inlining
the expected behavior is that the function returns the address of
the function that is returned to.  To work around this behavior use
the <code>noinline</code> function attribute.
</p>
<p>The <var>level</var> argument must be a constant integer.
</p>
<p>On some machines it may be impossible to determine the return address of
any function other than the current one; in such cases, or when the top
of the stack has been reached, this function returns an unspecified
value.  In addition, <code>__builtin_frame_address</code> may be used
to determine if the top of the stack has been reached.
</p>
<p>Additional post-processing of the returned value may be needed, see
<code>__builtin_extract_return_addr</code>.
</p>
<p>The stored representation of the return address in memory may be different
from the address returned by <code>__builtin_return_address</code>.  For example,
on AArch64 the stored address may be mangled with return address signing
whereas the address returned by <code>__builtin_return_address</code> is not.
</p>
<p>Calling this function with a nonzero argument can have unpredictable
effects, including crashing the calling program.  As a result, calls
that are considered unsafe are diagnosed when the <samp>-Wframe-address</samp>
option is in effect.  Such calls should only be made in debugging
situations.
</p>
<p>On targets where code addresses are representable as <code>void *</code>,
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">void *addr = __builtin_extract_return_addr (__builtin_return_address (0));
</pre></div>
<p>gives the code address where the current function would return.  For example,
such an address may be used with <code>dladdr</code> or other interfaces that work
with code addresses.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005fextract_005freturn_005faddr">Built-in Function: <em>void *</em> <strong>__builtin_extract_return_addr</strong> <em>(void *<var>addr</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>The address as returned by <code>__builtin_return_address</code> may have to be fed
through this function to get the actual encoded address.  For example, on the
31-bit S/390 platform the highest bit has to be masked out, or on SPARC
platforms an offset has to be added for the true next instruction to be
executed.
</p>
<p>If no fixup is needed, this function simply passes through <var>addr</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005ffrob_005freturn_005faddr">Built-in Function: <em>void *</em> <strong>__builtin_frob_return_addr</strong> <em>(void *<var>addr</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function does the reverse of <code>__builtin_extract_return_addr</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005fframe_005faddress">Built-in Function: <em>void *</em> <strong>__builtin_frame_address</strong> <em>(unsigned int <var>level</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is similar to <code>__builtin_return_address</code>, but it
returns the address of the function frame rather than the return address
of the function.  Calling <code>__builtin_frame_address</code> with a value of
<code>0</code> yields the frame address of the current function, a value of
<code>1</code> yields the frame address of the caller of the current function,
and so forth.
</p>
<p>The frame is the area on the stack that holds local variables and saved
registers.  The frame address is normally the address of the first word
pushed on to the stack by the function.  However, the exact definition
depends upon the processor and the calling convention.  If the processor
has a dedicated frame pointer register, and the function has a frame,
then <code>__builtin_frame_address</code> returns the value of the frame
pointer register.
</p>
<p>On some machines it may be impossible to determine the frame address of
any function other than the current one; in such cases, or when the top
of the stack has been reached, this function returns <code>0</code> if
the first frame pointer is properly initialized by the startup code.
</p>
<p>Calling this function with a nonzero argument can have unpredictable
effects, including crashing the calling program.  As a result, calls
that are considered unsafe are diagnosed when the <samp>-Wframe-address</samp>
option is in effect.  Such calls should only be made in debugging
situations.
