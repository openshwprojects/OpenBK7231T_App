<span id="index-regular-IPA-passes"></span>

<p>A regular IPA pass is a pass derived from <code>ipa_opt_pass_d</code> that
is executed in WHOPR compilation. Regular IPA passes may have summary
hooks implemented in any of the LGEN, WPA or LTRANS stages (see <a href="IPA.html">IPA</a>).
</p>
<ul>
<li> IPA whole program visibility

<p>This pass performs various optimizations involving symbol visibility
with <samp>-fwhole-program</samp>, including symbol privatization,
discovering local functions, and dismantling comdat groups.  It is
located in <samp>ipa-visibility.c</samp> and is described by
<code>pass_ipa_whole_program_visibility</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA profile

<p>The IPA profile pass propagates profiling frequencies across the call
graph.  It is located in <samp>ipa-profile.c</samp> and is described by
<code>pass_ipa_profile</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA identical code folding

<p>This is the inter-procedural identical code folding pass.
The goal of this transformation is to discover functions
and read-only variables that have exactly the same semantics.  It is
located in <samp>ipa-icf.c</samp> and is described by <code>pass_ipa_icf</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA devirtualization

<p>This pass performs speculative devirtualization based on the type
inheritance graph.  When a polymorphic call has only one likely target
in the unit, it is turned into a speculative call. It is located in
<samp>ipa-devirt.c</samp> and is described by <code>pass_ipa_devirt</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA constant propagation

<p>The goal of this pass is to discover functions that are always invoked
with some arguments with the same known constant values and to modify
the functions accordingly.  It can also do partial specialization and
type-based devirtualization.  It is located in <samp>ipa-cp.c</samp> and is
described by <code>pass_ipa_cp</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA scalar replacement of aggregates

<p>This pass can replace an aggregate parameter with a set of other parameters
representing part of the original, turning those passed by reference
into new ones which pass the value directly.  It also removes unused
function return values and unused function parameters.  This pass is
located in <samp>ipa-sra.c</samp> and is described by <code>pass_ipa_sra</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA constructor/destructor merge

<p>This pass merges multiple constructors and destructors for static
objects into single functions.  It&rsquo;s only run at LTO time unless the
target doesn&rsquo;t support constructors and destructors natively.  The
pass is located in <samp>ipa.c</samp> and is described by
<code>pass_ipa_cdtor_merge</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA HSA

<p>This pass is part of the GCC support for HSA (Heterogeneous System
Architecture) accelerators.  It is responsible for creation of HSA
clones and emitting HSAIL instructions for them.  It is located in
<samp>ipa-hsa.c</samp> and is described by <code>pass_ipa_hsa</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA function summary

<p>This pass provides function analysis for inter-procedural passes.
It collects estimates of function body size, execution time, and frame
size for each function.  It also estimates information about function
calls: call statement size, time and how often the parameters change
for each call.  It is located in <samp>ipa-fnsummary.c</samp> and is
described by <code>pass_ipa_fn_summary</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA inline

<p>The IPA inline pass handles function inlining with whole-program
knowledge. Small functions that are candidates for inlining are
ordered in increasing badness, bounded by unit growth parameters.
Unreachable functions are removed from the call graph.  Functions called
once and not exported from the unit are inlined.  This pass is located in
<samp>ipa-inline.c</samp> and is described by <code>pass_ipa_inline</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA pure/const analysis

<p>This pass marks functions as being either const (<code>TREE_READONLY</code>) or
pure (<code>DECL_PURE_P</code>).  The per-function information is produced
by <code>pure_const_generate_summary</code>, then the global information is computed
by performing a transitive closure over the call graph.   It is located in
<samp>ipa-pure-const.c</samp> and is described by <code>pass_ipa_pure_const</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA free function summary

<p>This pass is a regular IPA pass when argument <code>small_p</code> is false.
It releases inline function summaries and call summaries.
It is located in <samp>ipa-fnsummary.c</samp> and is described by
<code>pass_ipa_free_fn_summary</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA reference

<p>This pass gathers information about how variables whose scope is
confined to the compilation unit are used.  It is located in
<samp>ipa-reference.c</samp> and is described by <code>pass_ipa_reference</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA single use

<p>This pass checks whether variables are used by a single function.
It is located in <samp>ipa.c</samp> and is described by
<code>pass_ipa_single_use</code>.
</p>
</li><li> IPA comdats

<p>This pass looks for static symbols that are used exclusively
within one comdat group, and moves them into that comdat group. It is
located in <samp>ipa-comdats.c</samp> and is described by
<code>pass_ipa_comdats</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>
