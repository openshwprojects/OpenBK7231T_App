<span id="Options-Controlling-C_002b_002b-Dialect"></span><h3 class="section">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h3>

<span id="index-compiler-options_002c-C_002b_002b"></span>
<span id="index-C_002b_002b-options_002c-command_002dline"></span>
<span id="index-options_002c-C_002b_002b"></span>
<p>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs.  You can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <samp>firstClass.C</samp> like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, only <samp>-fstrict-enums</samp> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.
</p>
<p>Some options for compiling C programs, such as <samp>-std</samp>, are also
relevant for C++ programs.
See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.
</p>
<p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fabi-version=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fabi_002dversion"></span>
<p>Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI.  The default is version 0.
</p>
<p>Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C++ ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.
</p>
<p>Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.
</p>
<p>Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in G++
3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.
</p>
<p>Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.
</p>
<p>Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.
</p>
<p>Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.
</p>
<p>Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and &ndash;, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.
</p>
<p>Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a
builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.
</p>
<p>Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.
</p>
<p>Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
<code>nullptr_t</code>.
</p>
<p>Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention
attributes (e.g. &lsquo;<samp>stdcall</samp>&rsquo;).
</p>
<p>Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of
sizeof... expressions and operator names.  For multiple entities with
the same name within a function, that are declared in different scopes,
the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also
implies <samp>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</samp>.
</p>
<p>Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the calling
conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target and for classes
with only deleted copy/move constructors.  It accidentally changes the
calling convention for classes with a deleted copy constructor and a
trivial move constructor.
</p>
<p>Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental
change in version 12.
</p>
<p>Version 14, which first appeared in G++ 10, corrects the mangling of
the nullptr expression.
</p>
<p>See also <samp>-Wabi</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fabi-compat-version=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fabi_002dcompat_002dversion"></span>
<p>On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name.
This switch specifies which ABI version to use for the alias.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-fabi-version=0</samp> (the default), this defaults to 11 (GCC 7
compatibility).  If another ABI version is explicitly selected, this
defaults to 0.  For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through 4.9,
use <samp>-fabi-compat-version=2</samp>.
</p>
<p>If this option is not provided but <samp>-Wabi=<var>n</var></samp> is, that
version is used for compatibility aliases.  If this option is provided
along with <samp>-Wabi</samp> (without the version), the version from this
option is used for the warning.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-access-control</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002daccess_002dcontrol"></span>
<span id="index-faccess_002dcontrol"></span>
<p>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-faligned-new</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-faligned_002dnew"></span>
<p>Enable support for C++17 <code>new</code> of types that require more
alignment than <code>void* ::operator new(std::size_t)</code> provides.  A
numeric argument such as <code>-faligned-new=32</code> can be used to
specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function,
but few users will need to override the default of
<code>alignof(std::max_align_t)</code>.
</p>
<p>This flag is enabled by default for <samp>-std=c++17</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fchar8_t</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-char8_t</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fchar8_005ft"></span>
<span id="index-fno_002dchar8_005ft"></span>
<p>Enable support for <code>char8_t</code> as adopted for C++2a.  This includes
the addition of a new <code>char8_t</code> fundamental type, changes to the
types of UTF-8 string and character literals, new signatures for
user-defined literals, associated standard library updates, and new
<code>__cpp_char8_t</code> and <code>__cpp_lib_char8_t</code> feature test macros.
</p>
<p>This option enables functions to be overloaded for ordinary and UTF-8
strings:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">int f(const char *);    // #1
int f(const char8_t *); // #2
int v1 = f(&quot;text&quot;);     // Calls #1
int v2 = f(u8&quot;text&quot;);   // Calls #2
</pre></div>

<p>and introduces new signatures for user-defined literals:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">int operator&quot;&quot;_udl1(char8_t);
int v3 = u8'x'_udl1;
int operator&quot;&quot;_udl2(const char8_t*, std::size_t);
int v4 = u8&quot;text&quot;_udl2;
template&lt;typename T, T...&gt; int operator&quot;&quot;_udl3();
int v5 = u8&quot;text&quot;_udl3;
</pre></div>

<p>The change to the types of UTF-8 string and character literals introduces
incompatibilities with ISO C++11 and later standards.  For example, the
following code is well-formed under ISO C++11, but is ill-formed when
<samp>-fchar8_t</samp> is specified.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">char ca[] = u8&quot;xx&quot;;     // error: char-array initialized from wide
                        //        string
const char *cp = u8&quot;xx&quot;;// error: invalid conversion from
                        //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
int f(const char*);
auto v = f(u8&quot;xx&quot;);     // error: invalid conversion from
                        //        `const char8_t*' to `const char*'
std::string s{u8&quot;xx&quot;};  // error: no matching function for call to
                        //        `std::basic_string&lt;char&gt;::basic_string()'
using namespace std::literals;
s = u8&quot;xx&quot;s;            // error: conversion from
                        //        `basic_string&lt;char8_t&gt;' to non-scalar
                        //        type `basic_string&lt;char&gt;' requested
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fcheck-new</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fcheck_002dnew"></span>
<p>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<code>operator new</code> only returns <code>0</code> if it is declared
<code>throw()</code>, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<code>operator new</code> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <code>std::bad_alloc</code>.  See also
&lsquo;<samp>new (nothrow)</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconcepts</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fconcepts-ts</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fconcepts"></span>
<span id="index-fconcepts_002dts"></span>
<p>Below <samp>-std=c++2a</samp>, <samp>-fconcepts</samp> enables support for the
C++ Extensions for Concepts Technical Specification, ISO 19217 (2015).
</p>
<p>With <samp>-std=c++2a</samp> and above, Concepts are part of the language
standard, so <samp>-fconcepts</samp> defaults to on.  But the standard
specification of Concepts differs significantly from the TS, so some
constructs that were allowed in the TS but didn&rsquo;t make it into the
standard can still be enabled by <samp>-fconcepts-ts</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconstexpr-depth=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fconstexpr_002ddepth"></span>
<p>Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconstexpr-cache-depth=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fconstexpr_002dcache_002ddepth"></span>
<p>Set the maximum level of nested evaluation depth for C++11 constexpr
functions that will be cached to <var>n</var>.  This is a heuristic that
trades off compilation speed (when the cache avoids repeated
calculations) against memory consumption (when the cache grows very
large from highly recursive evaluations).  The default is 8.  Very few
users are likely to want to adjust it, but if your code does heavy
constexpr calculations you might want to experiment to find which
value works best for you.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconstexpr-loop-limit=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fconstexpr_002dloop_002dlimit"></span>
<p>Set the maximum number of iterations for a loop in C++14 constexpr functions
to <var>n</var>.  A limit is needed to detect infinite loops during
constant expression evaluation.  The default is 262144 (1&lt;&lt;18).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconstexpr-ops-limit=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fconstexpr_002dops_002dlimit"></span>
<p>Set the maximum number of operations during a single constexpr evaluation.
Even when number of iterations of a single loop is limited with the above limit,
if there are several nested loops and each of them has many iterations but still
smaller than the above limit, or if in a body of some loop or even outside
of a loop too many expressions need to be evaluated, the resulting constexpr
evaluation might take too long.
The default is 33554432 (1&lt;&lt;25).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcoroutines</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fcoroutines"></span>
<p>Enable support for the C++ coroutines extension (experimental).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002delide_002dconstructors"></span>
<span id="index-felide_002dconstructors"></span>
<p>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++
to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.
</p>
<p>In C++17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this
option still affects trivial member functions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002denforce_002deh_002dspecs"></span>
<span id="index-fenforce_002deh_002dspecs"></span>
<p>Don&rsquo;t generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<code>NDEBUG</code>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fextern-tls-init</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fno-extern-tls-init</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fextern_002dtls_002dinit"></span>
<span id="index-fno_002dextern_002dtls_002dinit"></span>
<p>The C++11 and OpenMP standards allow <code>thread_local</code> and
<code>threadprivate</code> variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn&rsquo;t actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in
another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the
<samp>-fno-extern-tls-init</samp> option.
</p>
<p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<samp>-fextern-tls-init</samp>.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is <samp>-fno-extern-tls-init</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002dgnu_002dkeywords"></span>
<span id="index-fgnu_002dkeywords"></span>
<p>Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <code>__typeof__</code> instead.
This option is implied by the strict ISO C++ dialects: <samp>-ansi</samp>,
<samp>-std=c++98</samp>, <samp>-std=c++11</samp>, etc.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates"></span>
<span id="index-fimplicit_002dtemplates"></span>
<p>Never emit code for non-inline templates that are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations.
If you use this option, you must take care to structure your code to
include all the necessary explicit instantiations to avoid getting
undefined symbols at link time.
See <a href="Template-Instantiation.html">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates"></span>
<span id="index-fimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates"></span>
<p>Don&rsquo;t emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either.
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization need the same set of explicit instantiations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines"></span>
<span id="index-fimplement_002dinlines"></span>
<p>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <code>#pragma implementation</code>.  This causes linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fms-extensions</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fms_002dextensions-1"></span>
<p>Disable Wpedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fnew_002dinheriting_002dctors"></span>
<p>Enable the P0136 adjustment to the semantics of C++11 constructor
inheritance.  This is part of C++17 but also considered to be a Defect
Report against C++11 and C++14.  This flag is enabled by default
unless <samp>-fabi-version=10</samp> or lower is specified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fnew-ttp-matching</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fnew_002dttp_002dmatching"></span>
<p>Enable the P0522 resolution to Core issue 150, template template
parameters and default arguments: this allows a template with default
template arguments as an argument for a template template parameter
with fewer template parameters.  This flag is enabled by default for
<samp>-std=c++17</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-nonansi-builtins</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002dnonansi_002dbuiltins"></span>
<span id="index-fnonansi_002dbuiltins"></span>
<p>Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include <code>ffs</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>_exit</code>,
<code>index</code>, <code>bzero</code>, <code>conjf</code>, and other related functions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fnothrow-opt</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fnothrow_002dopt"></span>
<p>Treat a <code>throw()</code> exception specification as if it were a
<code>noexcept</code> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to <code>terminate</code> rather than <code>unexpected</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-operator-names</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002doperator_002dnames"></span>
<span id="index-foperator_002dnames"></span>
<p>Do not treat the operator name keywords <code>and</code>, <code>bitand</code>,
<code>bitor</code>, <code>compl</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> as
synonyms as keywords.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-optional-diags</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002doptional_002ddiags"></span>
<span id="index-foptional_002ddiags"></span>
<p>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpermissive</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fpermissive"></span>
<p>Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <samp>-fpermissive</samp> allows some
nonconforming code to compile.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-pretty-templates</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002dpretty_002dtemplates"></span>
<span id="index-fpretty_002dtemplates"></span>
<p>When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. <code>void f(T) [with T = int]</code>
rather than <code>void f(int)</code>) so that it&rsquo;s clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use <samp>-fno-pretty-templates</samp> to disable them.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-rtti</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fno_002drtti"></span>
<span id="index-frtti"></span>
<p>Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ run-time type identification features
(<code>dynamic_cast</code> and <code>typeid</code>).  If you don&rsquo;t use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The <code>dynamic_cast</code> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <code>void *</code> or to
unambiguous base classes.
</p>
<p>Mixing code compiled with <samp>-frtti</samp> with that compiled with
<samp>-fno-rtti</samp> may not work.  For example, programs may
fail to link if a class compiled with <samp>-fno-rtti</samp> is used as a base 
for a class compiled with <samp>-frtti</samp>.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsized-deallocation</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fsized_002ddeallocation"></span>
<p>Enable the built-in global declarations
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
</pre></div>
<p>as introduced in C++14.  This is useful for user-defined replacement
deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object
to make deallocation faster.  Enabled by default under
<samp>-std=c++14</samp> and above.  The flag <samp>-Wsized-deallocation</samp>
warns about places that might want to add a definition.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstrict-enums</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fstrict_002denums"></span>

<p>This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.
</p>
<p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<code>__attribute__ ((visibility (&quot;hidden&quot;)))</code> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
</p>
<p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
</p>
<p>You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.
</p>
<p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.

<dt><code>-fvisibility-ms-compat</code></dt>
<dd><span id="index-fvisibility_002dms_002dcompat"></span>
<p>This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC&rsquo;s C++
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.
</p>
<p>The flag makes these changes to GCC&rsquo;s linkage model:
</p>
<ol>
<li> It sets the default visibility to <code>hidden</code>, like
<samp>-fvisibility=hidden</samp>.

</li><li> Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.

</li><li> The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
</li></ol>

<p>In new code it is better to use <samp>-fvisibility=hidden</samp> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
</p>
<p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.

<p>Do not warn about uses of <code>std::initializer_list</code> that are likely
to result in dangling pointers.  Since the underlying array for an
<code>initializer_list</code> is handled like a normal C++ temporary object,
it is easy to inadvertently keep a pointer to the array past the end
of the array&rsquo;s lifetime.  For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If a function returns a temporary <code>initializer_list</code>, or a local
<code>initializer_list</code> variable, the array&rsquo;s lifetime ends at the end
of the return statement, so the value returned has a dangling pointer.

</li><li> If a new-expression creates an <code>initializer_list</code>, the array only
lives until the end of the enclosing full-expression, so the
<code>initializer_list</code> in the heap has a dangling pointer.

</li><li> When an <code>initializer_list</code> variable is assigned from a
brace-enclosed initializer list, the temporary array created for the
right side of the assignment only lives until the end of the
full-expression, so at the next statement the <code>initializer_list</code>
variable has a dangling pointer.

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">// li's initial underlying array lives as long as li
std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; li = { 1,2,3 };
// assignment changes li to point to a temporary array
li = { 4, 5 };
// now the temporary is gone and li has a dangling pointer
int i = li.begin()[0] // undefined behavior
</pre></div>

</li><li> When a list constructor stores the <code>begin</code> pointer from the
<code>initializer_list</code> argument, this doesn&rsquo;t extend the lifetime of
the array, so if a class variable is constructed from a temporary
<code>initializer_list</code>, the pointer is left dangling by the end of
the variable declaration statement.

<p>Do not warn when a string or character literal is followed by a
ud-suffix which does not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming
extension, GCC treats such suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens
in order to maintain backwards compatibility with code that uses
formatting macros from <code>&lt;inttypes.h&gt;</code>.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">#define __STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {

<p>Warn when the destination of a call to a raw memory function such as
<code>memset</code> or <code>memcpy</code> is an object of class type, and when writing
into such an object might bypass the class non-trivial or deleted constructor
or copy assignment, violate const-correctness or encapsulation, or corrupt
virtual table pointers.  Modifying the representation of such objects may
violate invariants maintained by member functions of the class.  For example,
the call to <code>memset</code> below is undefined because it modifies a non-trivial
class object and is, therefore, diagnosed.  The safe way to either initialize
or clear the storage of objects of such types is by using the appropriate
constructor or assignment operator, if one is available.

<p>This warning warns about redundant calls to <code>std::move</code>; that is, when
a move operation would have been performed even without the <code>std::move</code>
call.  This happens because the compiler is forced to treat the object as if
it were an rvalue in certain situations such as returning a local variable,
where copy elision isn&rsquo;t applicable.  Consider:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct T {
&hellip;
};
T fn(T t)
{
  &hellip;
  return std::move (t);
}
</pre></div>

<p>Here, the <code>std::move</code> call is redundant.  Because G++ implements Core
Issue 1579, another example is:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">struct T { // convertible to U
&hellip;
};
struct U {
&hellip;
};
U fn()
{
  T t;
  &hellip;
  return std::move (t);
}

<p>In this example, copy elision isn&rsquo;t applicable because the type of the

<span id="index-Wno_002dtemplates"></span>
<p>Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.  Some coding

The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the STL, so
one can still use the STL.  One may also instantiate or specialize

<span id="index-Wno_002dmismatched_002dtags"></span>
<p>Warn for declarations of structs, classes, and class templates and their
specializations with a class-key that does not match either the definition
or the first declaration if no definition is provided.
</p>
<p>For example, the declaration of <code>struct Object</code> in the argument list
of <code>draw</code> triggers the warning.  To avoid it, either remove the redundant
class-key <code>struct</code> or replace it with <code>class</code> to match its definition.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">class Object {
public:
  virtual ~Object () = 0;
};
void draw (struct Object*);
</pre></div>

<p>It is not wrong to declare a class with the class-key <code>struct</code> as
the example above shows.  The <samp>-Wmismatched-tags</samp> option is intended
to help achieve a consistent style of class declarations.  In code that is
intended to be portable to Windows-based compilers the warning helps prevent
unresolved references due to the difference in the mangling of symbols
declared with different class-keys.  The option can be used either on its
own or in conjunction with <samp>-Wredundant-tags</samp>.

<p>Warn about placement new expressions with undefined behavior, such as
constructing an object in a buffer that is smaller than the type of
the object.  For example, the placement new expression below is diagnosed
because it attempts to construct an array of 64 integers in a buffer only
64 bytes large.

GCC allows as extensions for compatibility with legacy code.  For example,
the following <code>new</code> expression is not diagnosed at this level even
though it has undefined behavior according to the C++ standard because
it writes past the end of the one-element array.
