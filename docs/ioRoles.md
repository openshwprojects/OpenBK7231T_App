# IO Pin Roles
Here is the latest, up to date IO Roles.
This file was autogenerated by running 'node scripts/getcommands.js' in the repository.
All descriptions were taken from code.
Do not add anything here, as it will overwritten with next rebuild.
| RoleName     |  Description  |
|:------------- | -------:|
| None | Default pin role; this pin does nothing. |
| Relay | an active-high relay. This relay is closed when a logical 1 value is on linked channel |
| Relay_n | (as Relay but pin logical value is inversed) |
| Button | a typical button of Tuya device with active-low state (a button that connects IO pin to ground when pressed and also has a 10k or so pull up resistor) |
| Button_n | as Button but pin logical value is inversed |
| LED | an active-high LED. The internals of 'LED' are the same as of 'Relay'. Names are just separate to make it easier for users. |
| LED_n | (as Led but pin logical value is inversed) |
| PWM | Pulse width modulation output for LED dimmers (with MQTT dimming support from Home Assistant). Remember to set related channel to correct color index, in the RGBCW order. For CW only lights, set only CW indices. |
| LED_WIFI | special LED to indicate WLan connection state. LED states are following: LED on = client mode successfully connected to your Router. Half a second blink - connecting to your router, please wait (or connection problem). Fast blink (200ms) - open access point mode. In safe mode (after failed boots), LED might not work. |
