# Commands
Here is the latest, up to date command list.
This file was autogenerated by running 'node scripts/getcommands.js' in the repository.
All descriptions were taken from code.<br><br>
Please remember that some commands might require starting a related driver first, so, for example, you must first do 'startDriver DoorSensor' and then 'DSEdge 1'.
Also remember that commands can be put in autoexec.bat to run at startup (see Web Application->LittleFS tab).
<br><br>
Do not add anything here, as it will overwritten with next rebuild.
| Command        | Arguments          | Description  |
|:------------- |:------------- | -----:|
| SetChannel | [ChannelIndex][ChannelValue] | Sets a raw channel to given value. Relay channels are using 1 and 0 values. PWM channels are within [0,100] range. Do not use this for LED control, because there is a better and more advanced LED driver with dimming and configuration memory (remembers setting after on/off), LED driver commands has 'led_' prefix. |
| SetChannelFloat | [ChannelIndex][ChannelValue] | Sets a raw channel to given float value. Currently only used for LED PWM channels. |
| ToggleChannel | [ChannelIndex] | Toggles given channel value. Non-zero becomes zero, zero becomes 1. |

| fakeTuyaPacket | [HexString] | This simulates packet being sent from TuyaMCU to our OBK device. |
| tuyaMcu_setBaudRate | [BaudValue] | Sets the baud rate used by TuyaMCU UART communication. Default value is 9600. Some other devices require 115200. |
| tuyaMcu_sendRSSI |  | Command sends the specific RSSI value to TuyaMCU (it will send current RSSI if no argument is set) |
| tuyaMcu_defWiFiState |  | Command sets the default WiFi state for TuyaMCU when device is not online. It may be required for some devices to work, because Tuya designs them to ignore touch buttons or beep when not paired. Please see [values table and description here](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/viewtopic.php?p=20483899#20483899). |
| uartSendHex | [HexString] | Sends raw data by UART, can be used to send TuyaMCU data, but you must write whole packet with checksum yourself |
| uartSendASCII | [AsciiString] | Sends given string by UART. |
| uartFakeHex | [HexString] | Spoofs a fake hex packet so it looks like TuyaMCU send that to us. Used for testing. |
| uartInit | [BaudRate] | Manually starts UART1 port. Keep in mind that you don't need to do it for TuyaMCU and BL0942, those drivers do it automatically. |

| lfs_size | [MaxSize] | Log or Set LFS size - will apply and re-format next boot, usage setlfssize 0x10000 |
| lfs_unmount |  | Un-mount LFS |
| lfs_mount |  | Mount LFS |
| lfs_format |  | Unmount and format LFS.  Optionally add new size as argument |
| lfs_append | [FileName][String] | Appends a string to LFS file |
| lfs_appendFloat | [FileName][Float] | Appends a float to LFS file |
| lfs_appendInt | [FileName][Int] | Appends a Int to LFS file |
| lfs_appendLine | [FileName][String] | Appends a string to LFS file with a next line marker |
| lfs_remove | [FileName] | Deletes a LittleFS file |
| lfs_write | [FileName][String] | Resets a LFS file and writes a new string to it |
| lfs_writeLine | [FileName][String] | Resets a LFS file and writes a new string to it with newline |
| loglevel | [Value] | Correct values are 0 to 7. Default is 3. Higher value includes more logs. Log levels are: ERROR = 1, WARN = 2, INFO = 3, DEBUG = 4, EXTRADEBUG = 5. WARNING: you also must separately select logging level filter on web panel in order for more logs to show up there |
| logfeature | [Index][1or0] | set log feature filter, as an index and a 1 or 0 |
| logtype | [TypeStr] | logtype direct|thread|none - type of serial logging - thread (in a thread; default), direct (logged directly to serial), none (no UART logging) |
| logdelay | [Value] | Value is a number of ms. This will add an artificial delay in each log call. Useful for debugging. This way you can see step by step what happens. |
| logport | [Index] | Allows you to change log output port. On Beken, the UART1 is used for flashing and for TuyaMCU/BL0942, while UART2 is for log. Sometimes it might be easier for you to have log on UART1, so now you can just use this command like backlog uartInit 115200; logport 1 to enable logging on UART1.. |
| publish | [Topic][Value] | Publishes data by MQTT. The final topic will be obk0696FB33/[Topic]/get. You can use argument expansion here, so $CH11 will change to value of the channel 11 |
| publishInt | [Topic][Value] | Publishes data by MQTT. The final topic will be obk0696FB33/[Topic]/get. You can use argument expansion here, so $CH11 will change to value of the channel 11. This version of command publishes an integer, so you can also use math expressions like $CH10*10, etc. |
| publishFloat | [Topic][Value] | Publishes data by MQTT. The final topic will be obk0696FB33/[Topic]/get. You can use argument expansion here, so $CH11 will change to value of the channel 11. This version of command publishes an float, so you can also use math expressions like $CH10*0.0, etc. |
| publishAll |  | Starts the step by step publish of all available values |
| publishChannel | [ChannelIndex] | Forces publish of given channel |
| publishChannels |  | Starts the step by step publish of all channel values |
| publishBenchmark |  |  |
| mqtt_broadcastInterval | [ValueSeconds] | If broadcast self state every 60 seconds/minute is enabled in flags, this value allows you to change the delay, change this 60 seconds to any other value in seconds. This value is not saved, you must use autoexec.bat or short startup command to execute it on every reboot. |
| mqtt_broadcastItemsPerSec | [PublishCountPerSecond] | If broadcast self state (this option in flags) is started, then gradually device info is published, with a speed of N publishes per second. Do not set too high value, it may overload LWIP MQTT library. This value is not saved, you must use autoexec.bat or short startup command to execute it on every reboot. |
| TasTeleInterval | [SensorInterval][StateInterval] | This allows you to configure Tasmota TELE publish intervals, only if you have TELE flag enabled. First argument is interval for sensor publish (energy metering, etc), second is interval for State tele publish. |
| showgpi | NULL | log stat of all GPIs |
| setChannelType | [ChannelIndex][TypeString] | Sets a custom type for channel. Types are mostly used to determine how to display channel value on GUI |
| showChannelValues |  | log channel values |
| setButtonTimes | [ValLongPress][ValShortPress][ValRepeat] | Each value is times 100ms, so: SetButtonTimes 2 1 1 means 200ms long press, 100ms short and 100ms repeat |
| setButtonHoldRepeat | [Value] | Sets just the hold button repeat time, given value is times 100ms, so write 1 for 100ms, 2 for 200ms, etc |
