# Safe mode
Device is counting full boots (full boot is a boot after which device worked for 30 seconds). If you power off and on device 5 times in quick succession (but not too quick because device might have capacitors and they need to discharge every time), it will enter open access point mode/safe mode (safe mode means even pin systems are not initialized). Those modes are used to recover devices from bad configs and errors.
