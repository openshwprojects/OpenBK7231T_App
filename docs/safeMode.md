# Safe mode
Device is counting full boots (full boot is a boot after which device worked for 30 seconds). If you power off and on device multiple times, it will enter open access point mode and safe mode (safe mode means even pin systems are not initialized). Those modes are used to recover devices from bad configs and errors.
